## üìä Workflow Migration Summary

### Fully Migrated Workflows (6)
1. `claude.yml` - Base Claude Code functionality
2. `claude-code-review.yml` - Automated PR reviews
3. `claude-code-lia-integrated.yml` - Core LIA integration
4. `claude-enhanced.yml` - **MASTER WORKFLOW** (all commands)
5. `lia-claude-unified.yml` - Unified processing
6. `claude-code-config.yml` - Configuration workflow

### Integrated via Commands (7)
1. `lia-automated-maintenance.yml` ‚Üí `/maintenance`
2. `lia-cli.yml` ‚Üí `/cli`
3. `lia-code-generation.yml` ‚Üí `/generate`
4. `lia-issue-automated-triage.yml` ‚Üí `/triage`
5. `lia-issue-scheduled-triage.yml` ‚Üí `/schedule`
6. `lia-pr-review.yml` ‚Üí `/review`
7. `lia-autonomous-development.yml` ‚Üí `/develop`

## üí° Key Innovation: Unified Command Interface

The session's major innovation was creating a single entry point (`claude-enhanced.yml`) that can execute all 13 workflow capabilities through slash commands:

```yaml
# Single workflow handles ALL automation
- name: Route Command
  run: |
    if [[ "${{ github.event.comment.body }}" =~ /triage ]]; then
      # Execute triage workflow logic
    elif [[ "${{ github.event.comment.body }}" =~ /review ]]; then
      # Execute review workflow logic
    # ... handles all 10 commands
```
