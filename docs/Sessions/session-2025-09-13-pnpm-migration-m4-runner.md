## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. pnpm Migration

**Problem Identified:**
- Project needed `pnpm-lock.yaml` for consistent dependency resolution
- Internal workspace packages (`@igniter-js/*`) were failing resolution

**Solution Implemented:**
```bash
# Created pnpm workspace configuration
echo 'packages:\n  - "packages/*"\n  - "tooling/*"' > pnpm-workspace.yaml

# Updated package.json references
"@igniter-js/eslint-config": "workspace:*"
"@igniter-js/typescript-config": "workspace:*"
"packageManager": "pnpm@10.16.1"

# Generated lock file
pnpm install  # Created 8,440-line pnpm-lock.yaml
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ All 7 workspace packages resolved correctly
- ‚úÖ Build system functional (`npm run build` passes)
- ‚úÖ Internal dependencies properly linked
